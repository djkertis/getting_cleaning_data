# getting_cleaning_data
Course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

# Instructions
To run this script, you will need the following packages installed:
* dplyr
* reshape2

Once those are installed simply run "run_analysis.R".

The script will create a directory in your home directory named getdata and place a file in that directory named tidy_data.txt.

The contents of the tidy_data.txt file are described in the code book.
