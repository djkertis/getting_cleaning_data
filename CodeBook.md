# Getting and Cleaning Data 

## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
### Study Design

The data used for this project was collected from here.

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

### Variables
The resulting data frame will contain the following variables.  All the variables are averages by subject and activity.
* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The columns of the data set are as follows:
* `subject` - The unique ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed
* `tBodyAccMeanX`
* `tBodyAccMeanY`

### Data
The dataset includes the following files:

* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

### Transformations
* Activity IDs were converted to labels.
** 1 = `WALKING`: subject was walking during the test
** 2 = `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
** 3 = `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
** 4 = `SITTING`: subject was sitting during the test
** 5 = `STANDING`: subject was standing during the test
** 6 = `LAYING`: subject was layign down during the test
* Data files were merged to combine 1 data set.  This includes:
** Merging Subject, activity and measurement files.
** Merging Testing and Training Data.
* The data was grouped per activity per subject and the resulting measurements were averaged for each activity to product the output.
